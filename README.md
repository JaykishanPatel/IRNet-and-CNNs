# IRNet-and-CNNs

## Alexnet Folder

This is the space where I play around with pytorch and machine learning models. Current work includes weight visualization and fine tuning past models.

#### Current work in the repository

- Apr 20th Currently I have been able to use Dr. Murray's implementation of the IRNet model to show the intermediate actvations and weights for the convolution and deconvolution layers

#### Future work in the repository

- Soon to use the Imagenet localization 2014 dataset to train a 2 and 4 hidden layer CNN to perfrom denoising on the images
- Creating a dataset of geometic shapes with blender to train a CNN to perform reflectance extraction
- Creating multiple CNN arcitecture to to perform reflectance extraction
