# IRNet-and-CNNs

## Alexnet Folder

This is the space where I play around with pytorch and machine learning models (specifically Alexnet right now, as the name suggests). Current work includes weight visualization and fine tuning models for reflectance estimation in greyscale images.

#### Current work in the repository

- Currently I have been able to use Dr. Murray's implementation of the IRNet model to show the intermediate activations and weights for the convolution and deconvolution layers
- Working on re-creating models in current vision science literature and adapting them for different tasks (Alexnet, RESnet and IRNet)

#### Future work in the repository

- Soon to use the Imagenet localization 2014 dataset to train a 2 and 4 hidden layer CNN to perfrom denoising on the images
- Creating a dataset of geometic shapes with blender to train a CNNs to perform reflectance extraction
- Creating multiple CNN and deep-CNN arcitectures to better understand which techniques provide the best results to computation ratio
